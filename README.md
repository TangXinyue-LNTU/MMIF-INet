# [MMIF-INet: Multimodal Medical Image Fusion by Invertible Network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566253524004445?via%3Dihub)

## Overview
MMIF-INet is a novel invertible fusion network that directly accepts multi-channel images as inputs. It performs feature fusion in a process-reversible manner, ensuring the information of the source image pairs is preserved intact.

<mark>Please pay attention! Our method is only suitable for the fusion of color images and grayscale images.</mark>

## To Test
To test the MMIF-INet, run the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
